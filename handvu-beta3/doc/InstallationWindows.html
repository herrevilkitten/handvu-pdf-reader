    <h2>Installation on Windows</h2>

    This page explains how to install the binary and source
    distribution on a Windows platform.  For cygwin on Windows, please
    use the <a href="InstallationLinux.html">Installation on
    Linux</a>.

    <a name="requirements">
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Windows 2000/XP
        
      <li>a 1.5 GHz or faster CPU (performance increases superlinearly
      with a faster CPU)
        
      <li><a
      href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/">OpenCV</a>

      <li>a camera with 320x240 or greater resolution; either
      firewire, USB, or other frame grabber, that either works with
      the OpenCV demos or has a DirectShow source filter (most
      FireWire and USB cameras have this).  Support for libdc1394 is
      in the making.
        
      <li>Microsoft's DirectX SDK, if you want to build the HandVu
      DirectShow filter from source.
        
    </ul>


    <a name="binary">
    <h3>Binary package</h3>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Execute the downloaded MSI file.  If an error occurs, exit
      the installation.  If not, the installation has succeeded.

      <li>In case of failure, use the DllTester.exe (downdload from
      the homepage and run in a console) to check whether the DLLs are
      in the search path.  cv, cxcore, cvaux, and highgui are
      absolutely necessary.

      <li>Install with the MSI file again.  If an error occurs still,
      continue and finish the installation regardless.

      <li>Open a console, cd to the application directory (C:\Program
      Files\HandVu_*) and execute "regsvr32.exe HandVuFilter.ax".  If
      that fails, you'll have to compile the source package.
      Otherwise, the installation has completed.

    </ol>

    <a name="source">
    <h3>Source package</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>Get all the <a href="#requirements">required packages</a>,
      including the DirectX SDK.  Make sure their dlls are in the
      search path on Windows.

      <li>Create environment variables for the paths of the following
      headers and library (.lib) files.  Either right-click on My
      Computer, Properties, Advanced, Environment Variables, System
      Variables.  Or add them to autoexec.bat.

        <ul>
          <li>OpenCV include paths: INC_OPENCV, INC_OPENCV_CXCORE,
          INC_OPENCV_AUX, INC_OPENCV_HIGHGUI

          <li>OpenCV library path: LIB_OPENCV
            
          <li>DirectShow Baseclasses include path: INC_DX_BASECLASSES
            
          <li>DirectShow Baseclasses path to debug and release
            library: LIB_DX_BASECLASSES_DEBUG, LIB_DX_BASECLASSES_RELEASE
            
        </ul>
        
      <li>Unpack the archive into a directory of your choice.  First,
      compile and build the "cubicles" library.  Next, compile and
      build the HandVu library.  Lastly, build the application
      programs.  There are Visual Studio project files for all of the
      above.
        
      <li>For the DXApp to run, you must <i>register</i> the DXFilter
      COM module first, using regsvr32.exe.  Go to the directory in
      which the HandVuFilter.ax file resides, and call "regsvr32.exe
      HandVuFilter.ax".

      <li>If you get an error message during filter registration, make
      sure you have the required libraries in the search path.  That's
      the dll's to those libraries, not the lib files.  You can test
      this with the DllTester.exe.

      <li>If the DllTester.exe does not report any errors, but the
      filter still won't register, I would very much appreciate if you
      could run the <a
      href="http://www.dependencywalker.com/">Dependency Walker</a>
      tool on the HandVuFilter.ax file and tell me (matz) which
      libraries are not found and/or which symbols can not be
      resolved!  Thanks so much!

      <li> The DXApp requires an argument to be set:
      -c=fname.conductor, the file name of a HandVu configuration
      file.
        
      <li>The OpenCV-based capture application (hv_OpenCV) requires at
      least one argument, the conductor file (without -c=).

      <li>In the highly unlikely case that you want to uninstall
      HandVu Windows, go to the Control Panel, Add/Remove Programs and
      remove it from there, or simply execute the MSI installer again.

    </ol>

You probably got the executable distribution. Run the install.bat file.
If you get error messages such as DllRegisterServer failed, error code
0x80070005, you don't have admin rights on your machine. You need them
for installation.

Started with graphical method for selecting image regions and saving
them to individual bitmap files. Integration matrices are also generated,
and a stub for training the template-based classifiers is there. The
Doc/View architecture is based on "ITTS" files: training sets consisting
of a set of images (duplicates possible) with one square area in each.
